Testing Python Cheatsheet
==============================

A handout (in the executable handout collection) for a Testing Python
tutorial that I give covering unittest, doctest and coverage.

The content is stored as restructured text in ``handout.rst``.

Using the ``build.sh`` command it will generate an OpenOffice Writer
document with the handout neatly packaged inside it.  You might want
to make some tweaks there (or to the template file, ``3coltemp.odt``).
Then export to pdf or print.

Requires
========

* docutils

Testing
=======

This is an "executable handout".  Because it is written using Python
docstrings, you can actually test it or verify that it is somewhat
correct.  Run the ``testhandout.py`` to execute the tests.
